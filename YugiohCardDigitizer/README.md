# Summary

This is a database program project that utilizes a python Flash interface to manage an SQL lite
database to store and manage your Yugioh cards as a digital library.

# How Does it Work?
What can this program do for you? Here's what all this program does:
1. Add cards via a text entry interface, including uploading images!
2. Delete or modify existing cards if you need to make changes
3. View all the cards contained in your database
4. View cards one at a time for a more detailed view

# Requirements
In order to run this application, please make sure to:
1. Install all needed libraries using pip commands or right-clicking the import if your IDE supports it
2. Install tesseract in its default location of: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe. The installer .exe file is included in this project or go online to: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

And that's it!

# How to Run the Application
To run this application, simple run main.py and the app will be launched hosted under your local host address.

If you need to regenerate the database simply run create_database, and it will create a new database with seeded data
