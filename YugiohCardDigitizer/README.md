# Summary

This is a database program project that utilizes a python Flash interface to manage an SQL lite
database to store and manage your Yugioh cards as a digital library.

# How Does it Work?
What can this program do for you? Here's what all this program does:
1. Add cards via a text entry interface, including uploading images!
2. Delete or modify existing cards if you need to make changes
3. View all the cards contained in your database
4. View cards one at a time for a more detailed view
